\section{Data Management}
\label{sec:data_management}

The primary purpose of this section is to describe that data management has been able to support the operational aspects of running Rubin Observatory during commissioning

\begin{itemize}
    \item Calibration products and ISR during commissioning
    \item Brief description (paragraph or two; maybe a table) of data processing campaigns during on-sky commissioning, mainly reporting on the functional capabilities; algorithms and data products are discussed elsewhere; pointers to other references
    \item Figure with representative pixel-level color coadd images?
\end{itemize}

To provide feedback on the quality of the data and the performance of the system, Data Management runs processing campaigns on multiple timescales

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rapid Analysis framework - Quick Look payload @ summit
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Single-visit processing pipeline that supports decision-making during the night (e.g., RubinTV plots)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Prompt Processing framework - Alert Production payload @ USDF
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alert production and population of the Alert Production Database (APDB)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Rapid Analysis framework - Nightly Validation payload @ USDF
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Continuous near-real-time processing of individual visits during the night + daytime processing at USDF through coaddition, to support daily planning of commissioning observations
    \end{itemize}
    \item Batch Production System - Cumulative Data Release Production (DRP) @ USDF
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Full scale processing at USDF of ~2 weeks of data on target fields, to develop our best understanding of the state of the system and pipelines
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
