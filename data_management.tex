\section{Data Management}
\label{sec:data_management}

The primary purpose of this section is to describe that data management has been able to support the operational aspects of running Rubin Observatory during commissioning

\begin{itemize}
    \item Calibration products and ISR during commissioning
    \item Brief description (paragraph or two; maybe a table) of data processing campaigns during on-sky commissioning, mainly reporting on the functional capabilities; algorithms and data products are discussed elsewhere; pointers to other references
    \item Figure with representative pixel-level color coadd images?
\end{itemize}
