\subsection{Delivered Image Quality Distribution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Examples of some of our best images to demonstrate system capability
    \item Figure: distribution of PSF FWHM for an ensemble of visits
    \item Figure: PSF size and ellipticity distribution across field of view for an ensemble of visits
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Image Quality Budget}
