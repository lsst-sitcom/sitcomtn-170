\section{Delivered Image Quality}
\label{sec:image_quality}

Section Editor: (?)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure: distribution of PSF FWHM for an ensemble of visits; expect that we will want a comparison to the atmosphere seeing in order to estimate the system contribution
    \item Figure: average PSF size and ellipticity distribution across field of view for an ensemble of visits
    \item Figure: measured PSF size as a function of magnitude
    \item Figure: measured PSF size as a function of stellar color
    \item Figure: wings of PSF and encircled energy as a function of radius
    \item Brief discussion of current assessment of the image quality budget (expect that details of quantifying various contributions to the image quality budget will be discussed elsewhere?)
\end{itemize}
