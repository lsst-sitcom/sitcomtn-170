\subsection{Delivered Image Quality Distribution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Examples of some of our best images to demonstrate system capability
    \item Figure: distribution of PSF FWHM for an ensemble of visits
    \item Figure: PSF size and ellipticity distribution across field of view for an ensemble of visits
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Image Quality Budget}

Discussion on current assessment of the various contributions to the delivered image quality, accomplishments, open questions, outstanding issues

Discussion on current state of characterizing the atmosphere contribution

\subsection{PSF Characterization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure: PSF residuals across the field of view
    \item Figure: measured PSF size as a function of magnitude (could include brighter-fatter discussion)
    \item Figure: measured PSF size as a function of stellar color
    \item Figure: wings of PSF and encircled energy as a function of radius
\end{itemize}
