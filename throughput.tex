\section{System Optical Throughput for Focused Light}
\label{sec:throughput}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard bandpass; includes the sensors, filters, lenses, mirrors, and (a standard) atmosphere. Measured with CBP? Monochromatic flats with flat field screen?
    \item Imaging depth in multiple bands (LSR-REQ-0090); also express as zeropoint to separate out the effects of image quality; could be comparison to refcats and/or spectrophotometric standards
    \item Figure to show throughput variation of throughput across field of view (LSR-REQ-0109); potentially separating out vignetting and CCD response
    \item Discussion on Sensitivity Factor (fS) in the System Performance Diagram
\end{itemize}
