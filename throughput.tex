\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard bandpass; includes the sensors, filters, lenses, mirrors, and (a standard) atmosphere. Measured with CBP? Monochromatic flats with flat field screen?
    \item Imaging depth in multiple bands (LSR-REQ-0090); also express as zeropoint to separate out the effects of image quality
    \item Figure to show throughput variation of throughput across field of view (LSR-REQ-0109); potentially separating out vignetting and CCD response
\end{itemize}
