\setDocAbstract{%
From 15 April to 21 September 2025, the \VeraRubinObservatory conducted on an on-sky commissioning campaign using the LSST Camera (LSSTCam) to test the end-to-end functionality of hardware and software, as well as operational procedures.
This interim report provides a preliminary technical overview of our understanding of the integrated system performance based tests and analyses conducted during the on-sky commissioning campaign with LSSTCam.
The objectives are to synthesize what we have learned about the system in a timely way to inform Early Operations optimization, and to inform the Rubin science community on the progress of the LSSTCam on-sky campaign.
The report is organized into sections that describe major activities during the campaign, as well as multiple aspects of the demonstrated system and science performance.
All of the results presented here are to be understood as work in progress using engineering data and the initial versions of the data processing pipelines; the report is a living document that will be
updated as analyses are refined.
