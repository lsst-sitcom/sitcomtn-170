\subsection{Photometry}
\label{sec:photometry}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure: histogram of photometric repeatability for ensemble of visits; panel for each band?
    \item Figure: illumination correction
    \item Figure: average photometric residuals in focal plane coordinates for ensemble of visits; maybe a two-panel figure to show full focal plane and an individual detector
    \item Any other correlations of photometry that are worth exploring further (e.g., residuals w/ respect to stellar color, stellar flux, airmass)
\end{itemize}

Excellent agreement between predicted and measured chromatic response across the focal plane
