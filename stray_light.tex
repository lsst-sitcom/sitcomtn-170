\label{sec:stray_light}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure: examples of ghosts; are the features understood?
    \item Figure: examples of stray and scattered light; are the sources of stray and scattered light understood?
    \item Summative discussion on the impacts of stray and scattered light; how prevalent, amplitude and structure of the features, to what extent will additional baffling (e.g., with LWS) mitigate the features
\end{itemize}
