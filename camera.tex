\section{Sensor Performance and Instrument Signature Removal}
\label{sec:camera}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Usable pixels, effective field of view, fill factor
    \item Read noise
    \item Crosstalk
    \item Dynamic range (brightest and faintest objects)
    \item Summary table of key Camera performance metrics
    \item Section needs at least one figure to visualize focal plane; maybe a flat?
    \item Standard visit (i.e., snaps) evaluation?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Useable Pixels}

Field of View Area Factor (fA) for System Performance diagram

Could include a figure to show focal plane

\subsection{Sensor Characterization}

Summary discussion on

\subsection{Bright Stars and Moon}

On-sky validation that the Camera can survey the night sky in the presence of bright sources

\subsection{Sensor Anomalies}

Any sensor anomalies that are worth noting

\subsection{LSSTCam Performance during the LSSTCam On-sky Campaign}

Brief summary of LSSTCam performance during the campaign, any open questions, outstanding issues

This could include any discussion on Camera susbsystems, e.g., focal plane optimization, filter exchange system, cryo, camera shutter, that should be highlighted
