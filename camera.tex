Section Editor: (?)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Usable pixels, effective field of view, fill factor
    \item Read noise
    \item Crosstalk
    \item Dynamic range (brightest and faintest objects)
    \item Summary table of key Camera performance metrics
    \item Section needs at least one figure to visualize focal plane; maybe a flat?
    \item Standard visit (i.e., snaps) evaluation?
\end{itemize}
