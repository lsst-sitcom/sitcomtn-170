\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure: histogram of astrometric repeatability for ensemble of visits
    \item Figure: static camera astrometric distortion model
    \item Figure: average astrometric residuals in focal plane coordinates for ensemble of visits; two-panel figure to show full focal plane and an individual detector
    \item Figure: average E/B mode across ensemble of visits; expect to see mostly a pure E-mode astrometric field indicative of residuals dominated by astrometric turbulence
\end{itemize}
