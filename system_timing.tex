\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard Visit Duration (OSS-REQ-0288)
    \item Readout time â€“ discussed with the Camera?
    \item Time Interval Between Visits (OSS-REQ-0289)
    \item Maximum time for operational filter change (OSS-REQ-0293)
    \item Telescope Azimuth Slewing Rate (TLS-REQ-0029)
    \item Telescope Elevation Slewing Rate (TLS-REQ-0159)
    \item Summative assessment on rate of acquiring observations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Standard Visit Definition}

Discussion on decision to use 30-second exposures

\subsection{Visit Timing and Interval between Visits}

Camera readout time, filter change times

Telescope motion settings, slew and setttle, distribution of time between visits

\subsection{Effective Survey Speed}

Observing efficiency factor (fO) for System Performance diagram

Survey simulations combined with telescope motion capabilities; compare with actual rate of acquiring visits during SV surveys
